# name-to-ip: Map a guest name to an IP address

# There is no standard method of determining the IP address of a given guest.
# Therefore, MOM makes use of a helper program that can be customized according
# to the host network configuration.
#
# This script will be called with the domain name (as returned by the
# virDomainGetName() libvirt API).  The output should be an IPv4 IP address
# only.  On error, return nothing.

NAME=$1

# Example 1: The name is the IP address
# echo -n $NAME

# Example 2: The name is a valid hostname

# Example 3: The name contains a sequence number which maps directly to a range
# of local IP addresses
# NUM=${NAME##*-}
